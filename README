pysendfile was originally written by Ben Woolley including Linux , FreeBSD
and DragonflyBSD support.

Later on Niklas Edmundsson took over maintenance and added AIX support.

It's been completely rewritten by Giampaolo Rodola' (g.rodola@gmail.com) who
took over maintenance and added support for:

 * Python 3
 * non-blocking sockets
 * large files support
 * Mac OSX
 * Sun OS
 * FreeBSD flag argument
 * a simple benchmark suite
 * unit tests
