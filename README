pysendfile was originally written by Ben Woolley including Linux and FreeBSD
support.

Later on Niklas Edmundsson took over maintenance and added AIX support.

It's been completely rewritten by Giampaolo Rodola' (g.rodola@gmail.com) who
took over maintenance and added support for:

- Python 3
- OSX
- SunOS
- FreeBSD flag argument
- large files
- Linux header/trailer support via TCP_CORK socket option
- non-blocking sockets
